        <mark>Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs</mark>,
        that computers
        can follow to perform tasks.[1][2] It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step
        specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically use
        high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than machine code , which is
        directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several
        different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, <u>details of programming languages and
            generic
            code libraries, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</u><br>
        Code-breaking algorithms have also existed for centuries. In the 9th century, the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi
        described a cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code, in A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic
        Messages.<mark> He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis</mark>, the earliest
        code-breaking
        algorithm

        The first computer program is generally dated to 1843 when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to
        calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical
        Engine.<br>
        In the 1880s, Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form.[9] Later a control
        panel (plug board) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by the
        late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a
        similar way, as were the first electronic computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program computer
        introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory.

        The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with
        discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problems. For this purpose,
        algorithms are classified into orders using the so-called Big O notation, which expresses resource use, such as
        execution time or memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar with a
        variety of well-established algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose
        algorithms that are best suited to the circumstances.
