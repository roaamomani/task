    <h1><b><u>What is the introduction of math?</u></b></h1><br>
    Mathematics is the <mark>science and study of qualitym struturem spacem and change.</mark> Mathematicians sddk out
    patterns, fomulate new conjectures, and establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and
    definitions.<br>
    <br>
    There is debate over whether mathematical objects such as numbers and points exist naturally or are human creations.
    The mathematician <b>Benjamin Peirce</b> called mathematics "<u>the science that draws necessary conclusions</u>"
    <mark>Albert<br>
        Einstein</mark>, on the other hand, stated that "<u>as far as the laws of the mathematics refer to reality, they
        are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.</u>"<br><br>
    <u>today, mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields, including natural science,
        engineering, medicine, and the social sciences.</u> Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned
    with application<br>
    of <b>mathematical knowledge</b> to other fields, inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and
    sometimes leads to the development of the entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics,
    ot mathematics<br>
    for its own sake, without having any application in mind, although practical applications for what began as pure
    mathematics are often discovered later
