    <h1> Wikis are enabled by wiki software, otherwise known as wiki engines. A wiki engine, being a form of a content
        management system, differs from other web-based systems such as blog software or static site generators, in that
        the content is created without any defined owner or leader, and wikis have little inherent structure, allowing
        structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.[1] Wiki engines usually allow content to be written
        using a simplified markup language and sometimes edited with the help of a rich-text editor.[2] There are dozens
        of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems. Some
        wiki engines are free and open-source, whereas others are proprietary. Some permit control over different
        functions (levels of access); for example, editing rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material.
        Others may permit access without enforcing access control. Further rules may be imposed to organize content.
